# How To Get Started
1. If you have not already done so, download Node.js to your computer (installation website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
        If you are unsure whether you already have Node.js installed, run the command "node -v" in your terminal.
        If you have Node.js installed, you should see the version number pop up. If you see an error message instead, you can assume you do not have Node.js installed.
        If you know you have already installed Node.js, but you still don't see the version number pop up when you run the command "node -v", close and re-open your terminal and/or IDE and try again.
2. Open the project "Accredilink-Frontend" in your IDE.
3. Open the terminal and navigate into the root directory of your project (which should be Accredilink-Frontend).
4. Run the command "npm install" in the terminal (this will install all of your project's dependencies and create a node_modules folder in your project's root directory).
5. Run the command "npm start" in the terminal (this will open a web browser that will serve your application from your localhost server).
